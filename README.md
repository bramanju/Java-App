# Java-App

This is a simple Java application designed to hold different Traits of animals in their natural Habitat. 

There are different Animals implementing different behaviour like Eagle and Finch implements Aves (which can fly)
Each Animal has a specific set of characters or behaviour apart from the a general Animal behaviour like FreshWaterHabitat holds only GoldFish & Trout.
There will be few Animals which can live in more than one Habitat for example Turtle which lives in FreshWater and Land
Certain class like UrbanAreasHabitat will accept Mammalia & GoldFish just to show case a different trait of the Habitat (just to show that its possible)

Note: This is just a illustrative purpose, please dont take a literal meaning of Animals and Habitat from Natural Science

Design Goal
----------------
The Goal of the Design is to ensure that the Habitats should hold only specific set of Animals and not to allow even the Parent or Object 

Test
----
There are some testcases which will accept their natural habitat
There are restrictions to animals based on their natural Habitats (ofcourse some exceptions are there)
